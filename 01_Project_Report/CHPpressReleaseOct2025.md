CHP responds to media enquiries on Seasonal Influenza Vaccination School Outreach Programme

---

    In response to media inquiries regarding the latest situation of the Seasonal Influenza Vaccination (SIV) School Outreach Programme, the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (October 24) gave the following response:

All schools may choose to use live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV nasal vaccines)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    To further optimise the School Outreach Programme, this year all schools may opt for the LAIV nasal vaccines and the "hybrid mode", which allows schools to choose both the injectable inactivated influenza vaccines and the LAIV during the same or different outreach vaccination activities. So far, the CHP has not received any reports from schools or medical teams indicating that supply issues have prevented the arrangement of the LAIV nasal vaccine.

School outreach activities this season will generally be completed earlier than last season
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    To boost SIV rates, enrolment for the SIV School Outreach Programme has started since the beginning of June this year, which was earlier than last year. With the concerted efforts of the Government and various community sectors (including the medical sector and schools), approximately 2 300 schools (99 per cent) are going to arrange SIV school outreach activities. Among these, about 1 350 schools (59 per cent) have scheduled to carry out the outreach activities by the end of this month, and over 2 190 schools (95 per cent) by the end of next month (November), which are respectively higher than last year's 45 per cent and 83 per cent. All in all, this season's school outreach activities will generally be completed earlier than last season's.

    Since the start of the school year, about 930 schools have held SIV school outreach activities, which is higher than of 650 compared to the same period in the last season. In view of this year's summer influenza season, coupled with the recent increase in seasonal influenza activity and the number of school outbreaks, the CHP has actively contacted the schools in mid-October, urging them to try to further advance school outreach activities where feasible. Currently, 23 schools have responded to the CHP's call to advance their outreach activities, originally scheduled for December this year or January next year, to be held by the end of next month.

    The CHP expressed sincere gratitude to the schools and medical institutions which co-operated to advance vaccination activities. The CHP understands that participating schools have to take into account various objective factors such as the school calendar and staffing when scheduling school outreach activities, and coordinate with participating medical teams on the appropriate time. Should schools encounter any difficulties in advancing their outreach activities, they may contact the CHP during office hours at 3975 4872 and the CHP will provide full assistance.

Vaccine supply is subject to pharmaceutical companies' production schedules
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The World Health Organization (WHO) usually announces the seasonal influenza virus strains for the Northern Hemisphere from February to March each year. Pharmaceutical companies worldwide then produce appropriate vaccines based on the WHO's announcement for public procurement. Due to the time required for production and transportation, experience shows that vaccines normally arrive in different countries and regions between September and October the earliest. In the past two years, the CHP has actively engaged with pharmaceutical manufacturers with a view to secure vaccines as early as possible. This year, the CHP received the vaccines around mid-September.

    The CHP will continue to closely monitor the vaccine supply at the international level and the implementation of the SIV School Outreach Programme, striving to ensure stable vaccine supply and enhance the flexibility of the School Outreach Programme in order to meet the vaccination needs of different groups and better safeguard public health.
